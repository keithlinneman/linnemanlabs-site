The content bundle is a signed artifact containing all static HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and assets generated by Hugo. Additional provenance data is generated at build time. The server verifies bundle integrity at load time and exposes this provenance information via API. This page displays provenance information for the content bundle currently being served, including source information, build tooling with checksums, and file inventory.

You can view the full content source code for [linnemanlabs-site on Github](https://github.com/keithlinneman/linnemanlabs-site)
