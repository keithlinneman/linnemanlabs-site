This site publishes full provenance for both the application server and the content bundle it's currently serving. Everything on this page is derived from real build attestations and signatures - this is what I'm actually running and how it got here.

## Application

The application server is a custom Go binary built with security and observability as primary concerns. This section displays provenance for the currently running binary, including source information, build attestations, vulnerability scans, SBOMs, licensing, and container metadata.

Build/Release System Source: [build-system on GitHub](https://github.com/keithlinneman/build-system)

## Content Bundle

The content bundle is a signed artifact containing all static HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and assets generated by Hugo. The server verifies bundle integrity at load time and exposes provenance information via API.

## What's next

This page currently covers application and content provenance. I'm working toward attestations across the full trust hierarchy - from the application layer down through OS-enforced signed execution (IMA/EVM), dm-verity verified filesystems on golden images, kernel lockdown, UEFI Secure Boot, and TPM-based hardware attestation. The end goal is a verifiable chain from silicon to running application, where every layer's integrity is cryptographically anchored to the one below it.
