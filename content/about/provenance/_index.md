This site publishes full provenance for both the application server and the content it is currently serving. This site is dedicated to transparency and open-source, this page serves as cryptographic proof of what we are serving.

## Application

The application server is a custom Go binary built with security and observability as first-class concerns.

You can view the full application source code for [linnemanlabs-web on Github](https://github.com/keithlinneman/linnemanlabs-web)

This page displays provenance information for the currently running server binary, including source information, build attestations, vulnerability scans, SBOMs, licensing and container metadata.

## Content Bundle

The content bundle is a signed artifact containing all static HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and assets generated by Hugo. The server verifies bundle integrity at load time and exposes this provenance information via API.

## Future plans

In the future, this page will expand to include attestations across the full trust hierarchy, from Layer 7 application self-verification down through OS-enforced signed execution (IMA/EVM), dm-verity verified filesystems on golden images, kernel lockdown mode, UEFI Secure Boot, and TPM-based hardware attestation. The goal is a verifiable chain from the hardware root of trust to the running application establishing cryptographic proof from silicon to application with all of the code open-sourced along the way.
