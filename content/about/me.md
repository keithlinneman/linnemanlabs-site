## Keith Linneman

I've been doing this since the mid-90s - over 25 years of building, breaking, and operating systems. I started by breaking into them as a kid, living on IRC, learning how networks and operating systems actually worked by taking them apart. That offensive background shaped everything that came after. I moved into infrastructure and operations, bringing an attacker's perspective to how I design, harden, and monitor production systems. Now I'm circling back to offensive security with deep infrastructure and operations experience behind it.

I run LinnemanLabs as a working lab for security research and infrastructure engineering - documenting what I build and learn, and open-sourcing what I can.

My roots are in offensive security, and that's where the work is heading again. I'm researching how production infrastructure - especially observability pipelines - can be subverted from within, and I'm building systems where security properties are cryptographically provable rather than assumed. I want to bring that same rigor to ML systems and model supply chains as those problems mature.

### How I work

I'd rather understand one system completely than be passingly familiar with ten. Full-stack ownership means knowing how the system behaves from protocol to code to infrastructure to operations - not just the layer I'm responsible for on the org chart.

First principles over cargo culting. I understand the primitives end to end before I abstract or automate, and I trust what I can explain. If I can't reason about how something works, I won't trust it in production.

I prefer small, composable systems over big frameworks. When I learn a better model, I refactor and simplify rather than layering on complexity. I'd rather own fewer things well than accumulate technical debt across many.

I think security should be the default path, not a gate at the end. That means building guardrails into CI/CD, treating operability - telemetry, rollback, recovery - as a primary feature, and designing systems where the easy thing and the secure thing are the same thing.

These principles don't change just because the system is an ML model instead of a web server. Provenance, integrity, and verification matter regardless of what the artifact is.

### What I'm looking for

I'm interested in connecting with teams working on offensive security and red teaming, AI/ML security and model integrity, software supply chain security, or platform engineering where security is a first-class concern.

For the right problem, I go deep.
