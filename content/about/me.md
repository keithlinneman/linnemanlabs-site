## Keith Linneman

I am a cybersecurity and infrastructure engineer with 20+ years of experience designing, operating, red-teaming, and securing production systems. My career spans from early internet infrastructure to modern cloud-native platforms.

I run LinnemanLabs to document what I am building and learning, and to open-source some of it as I go.

### Areas of expertise
- Platform engineering and developer experience (paved roads, golden paths)
- Security architecture, threat modeling, and secure system design
- IaC and automation (repeatability, drift control, auditability)
- Observability, reliability, and incident response (MTTR reduction, learning-driven postmortems)
- Software supply chain security and attestation

### Current focus (2026)
- Secure-by-default platforms and workflows (policy, CI/CD guardrails, paved roads)
- Software supply chain security (SBOM, provenance, signing, verification, SLSA, Sigstore, TUF)
- Zero-trust networking and identity-first design
- AI/ML security (model provenance, supply chain integrity, adversarial robustness)
- Applying infrastructure and security rigor to ML systems and pipelines
- Infrastructure automation at scale

### How I like to work

- Full-stack ownership. I want to know how the system behaves from top-to-bottom (protocol -> code -> infrastructure -> operations)
- First principles over cargo culting. Understand the primitives end-to-end before abstracting or automating
- “Move fast and own things” - ship quickly with guardrails and then own reliability, security, and maintenance not just the proof of concept
- I trust what I can explain. If I can't reason about it, I won't trust it in production
- Prefer small, composable systems over big frameworks
- Automate controls and guardrails so security is the default
- Treat operability (telemetry, rollback, recovery) as a primary feature
- Challenge defaults and continuous redesign. When I learn a better model, I refactor and simplify rather than layering on more complexity
- Apply existing disciplines to new domains. Security and infrastructure principles don't change just because the system is an ML model

### Connect

I am particularly interested in connecting with teams working on:
- AI/ML security and model integrity
- Software supply chain security
- Platform engineering with security as a first-class concern
- Red teaming (traditional or AI systems)

For the right problem, I go deep.
