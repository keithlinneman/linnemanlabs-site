LinnemanLabs is live. I've been building and breaking systems for over 20 years and never really wrote any of it down publicly. That's what this is for.

I'll be writing about offensive security research, infrastructure engineering, supply chain security, ML performance and systems work, and whatever else I'm working on. If you want context on who I am, [start here](/about/me/). If you want to see what this site runs on, [the infrastructure page](/about/infrastructure/) covers the full platform. And if you're curious about the provenance data - every release is signed and attested, and [you can verify it yourself](/about/provenance/).
